Help us to translate the data retention visualisation into as many languages as possible!

All you have to do is to translate [en.json](https://github.com/opendatacity/vds-suisse/blob/master/generator/languages/en.json) into your language and push it as new "??.json". ([ISO 639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes))

If you have any questions you can contact us via Twitter [@opendatacity](https://twitter.com/opendatacity) or via mail [translate@opendatacity.de](mailto:translate@opendatacity.de)
