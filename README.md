## Where can I find it?

The application is online at http://apps.opendatacity.de/vds/index_en.html

## What we need?

We need help to translate the application into other languages, so that everybody on planet earth can understands the meaning of "metadata".

We describe the translation process here: [github.com/.../generator/languages](https://github.com/opendatacity/vds-suisse/tree/master/generator/languages)

## What's inside?

* ***/generator*** is a very simple template engine, that takes a language.json and generates HTML and JavaScript for a translated web version.
* ***/parser*** code that analyses the detained metadata, calculates the position of the cellphone and generates a big data.json for the web frontend.
* ***/print*** some graphics, to use e.g. for print.
* ***/sprites*** icons and stuff
* ***/tiles*** Tiles used for the socialnetwork map.
* ***/web*** The web frontend.
